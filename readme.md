## about

renames a pdf file to author-title-year.pdf or other formats based on your
selection. there isn't actually anything scholarly about this tool, though
academic people may find it useful for renaming pdfs that come in arbitrarily
named file formats. services like mendeley kind of make this not super
relevant. it helps when searching for a specific pdf and when labeling pdfs.
